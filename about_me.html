  <h1>Kailash Faris</h1>
  My wife and I went to LA last summer to visit my sister that lives out there.
  It was our first time meeting her corgi puppy, Nelly. We toured the boulevard,
  went to the beach, and had incredible food.

  <h3>Restaurant</h3>
  My favorite restsurant is probably 
  <a href="https://www.kfarcafe.com/" target="_blank">K'Far Cafe</a>
  in Philadelphia, PA. Its food is great (more on that in a second) and they are located
  in the center of the city by Rittenhouse Square so you can enjoy a great day in town!

  My favorite food there is the grilled cheese, but calling it a simple grilled cheese does not do it justice.
  It's long and filled with delicious spices. That with a good cup of their Yemenite Coffee
  and maybe a pastry is a perfect start to the day!

			<td>In this surreal book, belief creates gods that need followers to stay alive.
        The main character, Shadow, is a released convict who finds himself in the employ
        of an unknown god trying to rally other old gods against the new American gods of 
        the modern era. It reads like a dream.
