  <h1>Kailash Faris</h1>
  My wife and I went to California in 2021 to see family.
  We started in San Fransisco, visintg uncles and aunts on boths sides before driving down
  to see my sister in LA. The drive was gorgeous and we stopped in Santa Barbara for the night.
  The only downside was we couldn't drive along the ocean due to a rockslide.

  <h3>Restaurant</h3>
  My favorite restsurant is probably

  in Philadelphia, PA.
  <p>

  It has a tasy grilled cheese, but calling it a simple grilled cheese does not do it justice.
  It's long and filled with delicious spcies. That with a good cup of their Yemenite Coffee
  and maybe a pastry is a perfect start to the day!

			<td>In this surreal book, belief creates gods that need followers to stay alive.
        The main character, Shadow, is a released convict who finds himself in the employ
        of an unknown god trying to rally other old gods against the new American gods of 
        the modern era. It reads like a dream.
